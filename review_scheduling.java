// Problem: A student has M days to review N subjects. In his experience, reivewing subject j in i days will get him a score of A[i][j].
// Assuming A[i][j] >= 0 and A[i][j] < A[i+1][j], find X[j] (review days for subject j, with j = 1, 2,... m) such that sum(X[j]) = M
// and the student achieves the highest score (or sum(A[x[j]][i]) is maximum).
// Input file: First line: 2 positive integer M and N (0 <= N <= 50, 0 < N <= M <= 100)
// Next M lines, each line has N number indicating score the student will get if he review subject j in i days
// Output file: First line: Maximum score student can get
// Next N lines, each line has 2 number for the index of the subject and the number of days needed to review the subject
